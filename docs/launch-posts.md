## 1. Reddit — r/dataisbeautiful

**Title:** `I built an open-data dashboard tracking prosperity across 75 countries — no cookies, no tracking, just data`

**Body:**

Been working on the Global Prosperity Barometer — an open-data platform that scores
75 countries across 12 dimensions: governance, security, education, health, economy,
environment, and more.

Each country gets a 0-100 score per pillar, based on public data from the World Bank,
UN, Freedom House, and V-Dem Institute. You can compare countries side by side, explore
rankings, and see everything on an interactive map.

Some things I found interesting while building it:

- The gap between "full democracies" and "flawed democracies" is surprisingly narrow
  on most economic indicators
- Countries with the highest press freedom don't always have the lowest corruption
- Trade openness (exports as % of GDP) varies wildly even among wealthy nations

There's also a quiz if you want to test how well you know global affairs — 10 questions
generated from real data.

No ads, no cookies, no tracking, no login. All data is from public sources.

Feedback welcome — especially on what countries or indicators to add next.

## 2. Reddit — r/geopolitics or r/economics

**Title:** `Quiz: How well do you actually know global democracy, GDP, and corruption rankings?`

**Body:**

I made a 10-question quiz that tests your knowledge of global prosperity — democracy
scores, GDP per capita, corruption rankings, press freedom, government systems, and
conflict status.

All questions are generated from real data on 75 countries (World Bank, Freedom House,
V-Dem, UN sources). Every time you play, the questions are different.

I was surprised how often I got the corruption and press freedom rankings wrong — some
results are genuinely counterintuitive.

It's part of a larger open-data platform tracking prosperity indicators across 75
countries. No accounts, no cookies, no tracking.

Curious how others score — I averaged about 7/10 on my own data.

## 3. Hacker News — Show HN

**Title:** `Show HN: Open-data prosperity barometer – 75 countries, 12 pillars, no tracking`

**Body:**

I built an open-data platform that tracks prosperity indicators across 75 countries,
scoring each on 12 dimensions (governance, security, health, education, economy, etc.)
using data from the World Bank, UN, Freedom House, and V-Dem Institute.

Features:
- Country profiles with pillar scores, economic dashboards, and governance indicators
- Side-by-side country comparison with radar charts
- Interactive world map
- Prosperity quiz (10 random questions from real data)
- 12 languages, no cookies, no tracking (GoatCounter for anonymous stats only)

Stack: Vanilla JS, no framework. Data is static JSON served from GitHub Pages.

I'm especially interested in feedback on:
- What countries or indicators to add
- Data accuracy — if something looks wrong for your country, let me know
- UX on mobile
