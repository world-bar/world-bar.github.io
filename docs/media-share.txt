PHASE 1: REDDIT (Week 1–2)
===========================

Step 1: Create a Reddit Account
- Go to reddit.com → Sign Up
- Use a neutral username (e.g., DataVizFan2026, GlobalDataNerd)
- Use your Protonmail or a throwaway email
- Do NOT link any personal social media

Step 2: Build Karma (Day 1–2)
- Some subreddits block brand new accounts
- Browse r/dataisbeautiful, r/worldnews, r/economics
- Leave 10+ genuine comments on other people's posts
- Upvote content you like
- Wait 1–2 days before posting your own content

Step 3: Post on r/dataisbeautiful (Day 3)
- Go to reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful
- Click "Create Post" → choose "Link" post type
- Title: I built an open-data dashboard tracking prosperity across 75 countries — no cookies, no tracking, just data
- URL: https://gpb-world.github.io
- Click Post
- Immediately add a comment with the full body text (see docs/launch-posts.md)
- Best time: weekday morning US time (= afternoon in Germany)

Step 4: Post on r/geopolitics (Day 5–6)
- Go to reddit.com/r/geopolitics
- Click "Create Post" → choose "Text" post type
- Title: Quiz: How well do you actually know global democracy, GDP, and corruption rankings?
- Paste the body text from docs/launch-posts.md section 2
- Click Post

Step 5: After Posting
- Reply to EVERY comment within the first 2 hours
- Reddit's algorithm rewards early engagement
- Be genuine, not promotional — answer questions, accept criticism
- Never say "check out my site" — just answer naturally
- If someone asks about your tech stack: "Vanilla JS, no framework, static JSON on GitHub Pages"


PHASE 2: HACKER NEWS (Week 2)
==============================

Step 1: Create an Account
- Go to news.ycombinator.com
- Click "create account" (top of page)
- Choose a neutral username

Step 2: Post as "Show HN" (Day 7–8)
- Click "submit" in the top menu
- Title: Show HN: Open-data prosperity barometer – 75 countries, 12 pillars, no tracking
- URL: https://gpb-world.github.io
- Leave "text" field empty
- Click Submit
- Best time: weekday, 8–10am US Eastern (= 2–4pm German time)

Step 3: After Posting
- Reply to every comment quickly
- HN loves the "vanilla JS, no framework" angle
- Be ready to discuss technical decisions and data sources
- Accept feedback gracefully


PHASE 3: DIRECT SHARING (Ongoing)
==================================

WhatsApp Groups
- Share the quiz link: https://gpb-world.github.io/quiz.html
- Write: "I found this interesting quiz about world affairs — I scored X/10, can you beat me?"
- The quiz is your best hook — people love competing

Telegram Channels

Discord Servers

- Share in appropriate channels (not spam)

Facebook Groups

3. Be genuine, not salesy — you built something useful, not selling something
4. Use the quiz as your main hook — it's interactive and shareable
5. Each platform has different users — adjust your angle
6. Don't mention monetization (Buy Me a Coffee) in your posts
7. If something doesn't get traction, don't repost — try a different angle later
